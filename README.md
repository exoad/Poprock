**Poprock** is a resilient and lightweight framework designed to harness the extensive Java ecosystem for the swift and efficient development of desktop applications. Beyond constructing basic GUIs, the Poprock framework seamlessly extends its utility to the creation of straightforward games, music players, and other applications. In addition to desktop applications, Poprock can function as a standalone library for diverse tasks such as mathematical computations, audio processing, image processing, and more.

Furthermore, it is licensed under the free-to-use `BSD-4` license.
